# To-Do List Application

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a simple yet functional task management tool created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to maintain a list of tasks with the ability to add new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete completed or unwanted items. The data persists across sessions using the browser's `localStorage`.

Key features include:
- A clean UI with an input field for entering tasks.
- JavaScript-based functionality to add, edit, and delete tasks instantly.
- Tasks are automatically saved to and loaded from `localStorage`.
- Immediate updates to the user interface when task changes occur.
- Validation to prevent empty task entries.

## 🚀 Steps to Run/Test

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Use the input field to type a new task and hit the Add button.
3. Verify the task appears in the list below.
4. Use the Edit option to change any existing task.
5. Use the Delete option to remove any task from the list.
6. Refresh the page — tasks should still be visible due to localStorage.
7. Inspect the browser console for any errors or debug messages if needed.
