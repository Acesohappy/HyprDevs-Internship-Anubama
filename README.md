- Input field to add new tasks
- Task list display with Edit and Delete buttons
- Instant UI update for task actions
- Tasks saved and loaded via `localStorage`

### 🚀 Steps to Run/Test

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## 🔹 Task 3: Weather App Using API

### 📝 Project Overview

This task is a real-time weather application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display current weather information based on city name input. It demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript with `fetch` and `async/await`, as well as dynamic UI updates.

Key features:
- Input field for city name
- Fetches weather data including temperature, condition, and humidity
- Changes background or icon based on weather conditions
- Handles errors (e.g., city not found)

### 🚀 Steps to Run/Test

1. Register at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and obtain an API key.
2. Open `script.js` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Enter a city name and hit search to display current weather.
5. Try invalid city names to test error handling.
6. Observe how background or icons change with weather.
