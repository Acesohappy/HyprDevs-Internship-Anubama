# Personal Portfolio Webpage

## üìù Project Overview

This project is a responsive personal portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to showcase a developer's profile with structured sections such as Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The design focuses on clean UI, intuitive navigation, and form validation. The website demonstrates knowledge of semantic HTML, responsive CSS using Flexbox and media queries, and interactive JavaScript features like menu toggling and alert messages.

Key features include:
- A fixed navigation bar with smooth section scrolling.
- An About section featuring a short bio and personal image.
- A Projects section with cards describing at least 3 sample projects.
- A Contact form with input validation for name, email, and message.
- A JavaScript-powered alert on successful form submission.
- Fully responsive layout adaptable to all screen sizes.

3. Browse through the sections using the navigation bar.
4. Fill in the Contact form and submit it to test the JavaScript alert and validation.
