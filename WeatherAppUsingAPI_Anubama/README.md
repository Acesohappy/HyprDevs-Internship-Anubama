# Weather App Using OpenWeatherMap API

## üìù Project Overview

This is a dynamic weather forecasting web app that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to display real-time weather data based on a user's city input. It showcases the use of JavaScript‚Äôs Fetch API with async/await, as well as JSON parsing and DOM manipulation for dynamic UI updates.

Key features include:
- Input field to search for any city by name.
- Fetches and displays current weather details like temperature, weather condition, and humidity.
- Responsive design with background/icon updates based on weather type (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
- Error handling for invalid inputs or unrecognized city names.
- Modern UI designed for both desktop and mobile devices.

## üöÄ Steps to Run/Test

1. Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and create a free account to get your API key.
2. Open the `script.js` file and replace the placeholder text `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.
3. Save the file and open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
4. Enter the name of a city (e.g., "Chennai") in the input field and submit.
5. Observe the weather data displayed on the screen along with appropriate visuals.
6. Test error handling by entering an invalid city name (e.g., "Abcdxyz").
7. Optionally test in mobile view or small browser windows to check responsive layout.
